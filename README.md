This is my coursework submission for my Artificial Intelligence class.
It consists of a Jupyter notebook containing the questions in the coursework, along with written and coded answers.

### Question 1

Question 1 is an A* search algorithm implemented to solve the 8-tile puzzle using two different heuristic functions, misplaced tiles and manhattan distance.
