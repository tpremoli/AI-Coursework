    "## Question 1: Implement a heuristic search algorithm: A*\n",
    "#### Question 1.1: Describe how you would frame the 8-puzzle problem as a search problem\n",
	"\n",
    "The 8-puzzle problem can be looked at as a search problem, as each possible state of the puzzle can be represented as nodes in a graph, with the arcs representing legal moves between states. The start state is a randomly picked arrangement of tiles. The goal state is the desired final order of tiles. The cost of transition from one state to another is 1. Valid operations are moves where a number adjacent to the blank space moves into the blank space (blank space is swapped with an adjacent tile).\n",
    "\n",
    "Framing the problem as a search, we are trying to find the path from the start state to the goal state with the lowest cost possible. In game terms, we must order the tiles as instructed with the least number of moves possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
	"#### Question 1.2: Solve the 8-puzzle problem using A*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In this question you should first briefly outline the A* algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The A* algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm which goes towards the node that appears to be closest to the goal, while also including the cost of reaching said node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cheapest path to a goal state through a given node N is equal to the cost of reaching N plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal node from N\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have start node **S**, current node **C**, and goal node **G**. **P** is a list containing nodes accessed in order (Current path).\n",
    "\n",
    "f(N) is a function estimating the cheapest path to G passing through N.\n",
    "g(N) is the cost of reaching N from C.\n",
    "h(N) is the estimated cost of reaching G from N\n",
    "\n",
    "`f(N) = g(N) + h(N)`\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Start at state S, which is now C. Add C to P.\n",
    "    2. Calculate f(N) for each adjacent node.\n",
    "    3. Move to the node with the lowest value of f(N). C now equals N. Add C to the end of P.\n",
    "    4. If C is the same as G, you have found path P and you can terminate the algorithm.\n",
    "    5. If not, return to step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Describe **two** admissible heuristic functions for the 8-puzzle problem and explain why they are admissible. Make sure you also explain why you chose these two heursitic functions in particular amongst all the possible ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristic 1:** Number of tiles out of place.\n",
    "\n",
    "This heuristic means that h(N) is equal to the number of tiles out of place in state N. This heuristic is admissible, as it never overestimates; the minimum number of moves to reach a goal state from N is equal to the number of tiles out of place, as each misplaced tile must be moved at least once to reach the goal state. This heuristic was chosen as it's one of the simplest to understand and implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristic 2:** Sum of spaces between tiles and their final states. (Manhattan distance)\n",
    "\n",
    "This heuristic means that h(N) is the sum of the spaces between all tiles and their required final states; If tile A has 2 slots between it and its final state, tile B has 3, and tile C has 1: h(ABC) = 6. This heuristic is admissible as the number of spaces between each tile is equal to the minimum number of moves to get tiles to their final positions. If there is 3 spaces between A and its final state, the minimum number of moves, and therefore cost to get A to its final state is 3. This heuristic was chosen as it's still fairly simple to understand, however, having more information than heuristic 1 should make it faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then, you should implement **two** versions of the A* algorithm in Python to solve the 8-puzzle using the two heuristic functions you have chosen. You can either implement the two versions in the same Python script, letting the user select which one to use before running the code, or you can have two different scripts if you prefer. To test that it works, you can use the start and goal state of Figure 1 (however, note that this may take a few minutes to run depending on your computer, implementation, and choice of heuristic functions), or you can specify your own initial and goal state. If you specify your own initial and goal state, select states which are **at least** five moves apart from each other and **write** these states in your report.\n",
