    "### Question 1: Implement a heuristic search algorithm: A* and\n",
    "#### Question 1.1: Describe how you would frame the 8-puzzle problem as a search problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The 8-puzzle problem can be looked at as a search problem, as each possible state of the puzzle can be represented as nodes in a graph, with the arcs representing legal moves between states. The start state is a randomly picked arrangement of tiles. The goal state is the desired final order of tiles. The cost of transition from one state to another is 1. Valid operations are moves where a number adjacent to the blank space moves into the blank space (blank space is swapped with an adjacent tile).\n",
    "\n",
    "Framing the problem as a search, we are trying to find the path from the start state to the goal state with the lowest cost possible. In game terms, we must order the tiles as instructed with the least number of moves possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 1.2: Solve the 8-puzzle problem using A*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In this question you should first briefly outline the A* algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The A* algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm which goes towards the node that appears to be closest to the goal, while also including the cost of reaching said node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cheapest path to a goal state through a given node N is equal to the cost of reaching N plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal node from N\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have start node **S**, current node **C**, and goal node **G**. **P** is a list containing nodes accessed in order (Current path).\n",
    "\n",
    "f(N) is a function estimating the cheapest path to G passing through N.\n",
    "g(N) is the cost of reaching N from C.\n",
    "h(N) is the estimated cost of reaching G from N\n",
    "\n",
    "`f(N) = g(N) + h(N)`\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Start at state S, which is now C. Add C to P.\n",
    "    2. Calculate f(N) for each adjacent node.\n",
    "    3. Move to the node with the lowest value of f(N). C now equals N. Add C to the end of P.\n",
    "    4. If C is the same as G, you have found path P and you can terminate the algorithm.\n",
    "    5. If not, return to step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Describe **two** admissible heuristic functions for the 8-puzzle problem and explain why they are admissible. Make sure you also explain why you chose these two heursitic functions in particular amongst all the possible ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristic 1:** Number of tiles out of place.\n",
    "\n",
    "This heuristic means that h(N) is equal to the number of tiles out of place in state N. This heuristic is admissible, as it never overestimates; the minimum number of moves to reach a goal state from N is equal to the number of tiles out of place, as each misplaced tile must be moved at least once to reach the goal state. This heuristic was chosen as it's one of the simplest to understand and implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristic 2:** Sum of spaces between tiles and their final states. (Manhattan distance)\n",
    "\n",
    "This heuristic means that h(N) is the sum of the spaces between all tiles and their required final states; If tile A has 2 slots between it and its final state, tile B has 3, and tile C has 1: h(ABC) = 6. This heuristic is admissible as the number of spaces between each tile is equal to the minimum number of moves to get tiles to their final positions. If there is 3 spaces between A and its final state, the minimum number of moves, and therefore cost to get A to its final state is 3. This heuristic was chosen as it's still fairly simple to understand, however, having more information than heuristic 1 should make it faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then, you should implement **two** versions of the A* algorithm in Python to solve the 8-puzzle using the two heuristic functions you have chosen. You can either implement the two versions in the same Python script, letting the user select which one to use before running the code, or you can have two different scripts if you prefer. To test that it works, you can use the start and goal state of Figure 1 (however, note that this may take a few minutes to run depending on your computer, implementation, and choice of heuristic functions), or you can specify your own initial and goal state. If you specify your own initial and goal state, select states which are **at least** five moves apart from each other and **write** these states in your report.\n",

    "In both scenarios, the algorithm gave the optimal result for the inputs and goal states given. Both have the same number of moves (26) and follow the exact same steps to reach the goal state. The primary difference between the two heuristic functions was the efficiency and speed of their execution. The misplaced tiles heuristic visited a grand total of **34038** nodes in the graph, compared to the manhattan distance heuristic's total of **2823**, which is a difference of more than 10 times. This means that the space complexity and also time complexity of the misplaced tiles heuristic was much higher, as not only was the overall graph significantly bigger, but the analysis of all those nodes increased the time taken. This is likely due to the fact that the manhattan heuristic provides more information about the desirability of certain nodes; the misplaced tiles heuristic will return the same heuristic for large swathes of tiles with very different desirabilities in practice, meaning overall it results in a much longer calculation."

    "        The selection method will be directly proportional to the fitness function for each individual; the 50% with the highest fitness will be discarded. Replacement is then done by running the crossover operation on a random pair of individuals, which then populates the new generation. This is done until the new generation is the same as the desired population size.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    g) Choose an appropriate termination criterion\n",
    "    \n",
    "        The termination criterion will be that the sudoku grid has no repeating numbers in columns, rows, or subsections. If the simulation doesn't get to a full solution, the termination criterion will cap the maximum generation count at 5,000 generations.\n",

    "you should first briefly outline how you are representing the Sudoko\n",

    "2. Then you should implement the evolutionary algorithm in Python to solve the Sudoku problem. You will need to run experiments for the three Sudoku grids provided on the ELE page, for population sizes 10, 100, 1000, 10000. Each experiment needs to be ran 5 times (Each with a different random seed) and average performance across runs considered. In total these amount to 60 runs.\n",

    "#### Question 2.2: Analyze the Sudoko problem using Evolutionary algorithm\n",
    "This question will help guide you to analyize your results based on the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What population size was the best?\n",
    "2. What do you think is the reason for your findings in question 8.a?\n",
    "3. Which grid was the easiest and which was the hardest to solve?\n",
    "4. What do you think might be the reason for your findings in question 8c?\n",
    "5. What further experiments do you think it may be useful to do and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, my implementation for an evolutionary algorithm was satisfactory. Although smaller population sizes didn't get the result in 5,000 generations, with a high enough population it could reliably get very close to the answer in the provided grid examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best population was the population of 10,000. In this population size, the absolute best run was 39 generations, and the worst was 90 generations. This measure was also fairly consistent in how long it took, with the difference between the longest and shortest runs in each grid being a difference of just 19 generations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The population size of 1,000 was also able to get the result in a reasonable amount of time, however could be wildly inconsistent. In the same grid, there could be differences in performance in the hundreds, likely due to the lower population size causing the algorithm to get stuck in local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the population sizes of 10 and 100 were similarly unsatisfactory. The sample sizes were just too small to allow the diversity and mutations for a genetic algorithm to work very well. The population size of 100 was better than the population of 10 (in most cases), however neither reached a fitness of 4 except for the 100 population in 3819 generations on grid 2. This is likely just a one-off lucky shot, as no other run was able to get that close to a final solution. Given enough generations, these could potentially converge to a solution, however it could take a very long time, as such low population counts encourage too much elitism, especially for a game with as many potential board setups as sudoku.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest grid to solve was grid #2, having the lowest average generation count for the populations of 10,000 and 1,000. Specifically, the population of 1000 was on average 30 generations faster than the second fastest, grid #1. Beyond that, the population of 100 achieved the lowest average fitness value. This is likely due to the fact that grid 2 started with the most numbers already filled in, at 33 out of 81 tiles already having their values inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most difficult grid to solve was grid #3, having the highest average generation count for the populations of 10,000 and 1,000. For 10,000, the average generation count was 36.8 more than the fastest grid. For 1,000, this difference was 136.6 generations. Beyond that, the generation of 10's average fitness went down to just 17 in 5,000 generations, which makes it much slower than the average fitness of 11.6 in the fastest example. This is likely due to the fact that this grid had the least number of tiles already filled in, at just 23 of 81 tiles already having their values inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a further exploration, ideally there would be more runs of the simulation for each sample size and grid, a higher maximum generation count, and a method to track the total time taken to reach each goal. The higher run count would allow the data to \"flatten out\" and stop outliers from having such a high impact on the overall records. A higher maximum generation count would allow for easier comparison of records that take longer by allowing them to reach the final goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we track the total time taken to reach the goal, the experiment could be expnded significantly. By considering this factor, we could determine what the actual optimal population size is; by combining the generation count with the time taken, we could minimize the amount of time and space it takes to get an optimal solution. Higher population counts take up more memory and more time to calculate each generation, so a lower population count could be more optimal depending on the goal of the user (efficiency or effectiveness).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, for a genetic algorithm on a Sudoku puzzle, this algorithm worked well. With high enough population counts, the solutions were found in a reasonable number of generations. In the future it'd be worth trying different crossover and mutation functions, however for the purposes of this experiment, these worked well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, however, an evolutionary algorithm wasn't ideal for a sudoku puzzle. As there is usually a very small number of solutions but a huge number of local minima, it's very common to get close to a perfect solution but never actually reach the answer. It's due to this reason that my desired fitness was 4 instead of 0; in my practice runs, reaching a fitness of 0 took so long that it was unreasonable to test for a perfect answer. Ideally a search would be used to calculate the solution for the last few repeating squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless, this experiment was insightful to the capability of intentional randomness; the random crossover events and the random mutations along with a careful selection function lead the system to a perfect solution. It's not hard to see how these types of algorithms can be implemented into more complex and important problems."
