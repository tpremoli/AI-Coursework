    "### Question 1: Implement a heuristic search algorithm: A* and\n",
    "#### Question 1.1: Describe how you would frame the 8-puzzle problem as a search problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The 8-puzzle problem can be looked at as a search problem, as each possible state of the puzzle can be represented as nodes in a graph, with the arcs representing legal moves between states. The start state is a randomly picked arrangement of tiles. The goal state is the desired final order of tiles. The cost of transition from one state to another is 1. Valid operations are moves where a number adjacent to the blank space moves into the blank space (blank space is swapped with an adjacent tile).\n",
    "\n",
    "Framing the problem as a search, we are trying to find the path from the start state to the goal state with the lowest cost possible. In game terms, we must order the tiles as instructed with the least number of moves possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question 1.2: Solve the 8-puzzle problem using A*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In this question you should first briefly outline the A* algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The A* algorithm is a heuristic search algorithm which goes towards the node that appears to be closest to the goal, while also including the cost of reaching said node.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cheapest path to a goal state through a given node N is equal to the cost of reaching N plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal node from N\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have start node **S**, current node **C**, and goal node **G**. **P** is a list containing nodes accessed in order (Current path).\n",
    "\n",
    "f(N) is a function estimating the cheapest path to G passing through N.\n",
    "g(N) is the cost of reaching N from C.\n",
    "h(N) is the estimated cost of reaching G from N\n",
    "\n",
    "`f(N) = g(N) + h(N)`\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Start at state S, which is now C. Add C to P.\n",
    "    2. Calculate f(N) for each adjacent node.\n",
    "    3. Move to the node with the lowest value of f(N). C now equals N. Add C to the end of P.\n",
    "    4. If C is the same as G, you have found path P and you can terminate the algorithm.\n",
    "    5. If not, return to step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Describe **two** admissible heuristic functions for the 8-puzzle problem and explain why they are admissible. Make sure you also explain why you chose these two heursitic functions in particular amongst all the possible ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristic 1:** Number of tiles out of place.\n",
    "\n",
    "This heuristic means that h(N) is equal to the number of tiles out of place in state N. This heuristic is admissible, as it never overestimates; the minimum number of moves to reach a goal state from N is equal to the number of tiles out of place, as each misplaced tile must be moved at least once to reach the goal state. This heuristic was chosen as it's one of the simplest to understand and implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristic 2:** Sum of spaces between tiles and their final states. (Manhattan distance)\n",
    "\n",
    "This heuristic means that h(N) is the sum of the spaces between all tiles and their required final states; If tile A has 2 slots between it and its final state, tile B has 3, and tile C has 1: h(ABC) = 6. This heuristic is admissible as the number of spaces between each tile is equal to the minimum number of moves to get tiles to their final positions. If there is 3 spaces between A and its final state, the minimum number of moves, and therefore cost to get A to its final state is 3. This heuristic was chosen as it's still fairly simple to understand, however, having more information than heuristic 1 should make it faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then, you should implement **two** versions of the A* algorithm in Python to solve the 8-puzzle using the two heuristic functions you have chosen. You can either implement the two versions in the same Python script, letting the user select which one to use before running the code, or you can have two different scripts if you prefer. To test that it works, you can use the start and goal state of Figure 1 (however, note that this may take a few minutes to run depending on your computer, implementation, and choice of heuristic functions), or you can specify your own initial and goal state. If you specify your own initial and goal state, select states which are **at least** five moves apart from each other and **write** these states in your report.\n",

    "In both scenarios, the algorithm gave the optimal result for the inputs and goal states given. Both have the same number of moves (26) and follow the exact same steps to reach the goal state. The primary difference between the two heuristic functions was the efficiency and speed of their execution. The misplaced tiles heuristic visited a grand total of **34038** nodes in the graph, compared to the manhattan distance heuristic's total of **2823**, which is a difference of more than 10 times. This means that the space complexity and also time complexity of the misplaced tiles heuristic was much higher, as not only was the overall graph significantly bigger, but the analysis of all those nodes increased the time taken. This is likely due to the fact that the manhattan heuristic provides more information about the desirability of certain nodes; the misplaced tiles heuristic will return the same heuristic for large swathes of tiles with very different desirabilities in practice, meaning overall it results in a much longer calculation."

    "\n",
    "#### Question 2.1: Design and implement the Sudoko problem using Evolutionary algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, design your evolutionary algorithm addressing the following points in your design process\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a) Choose an appropriate solution space and solution representation\n",
    "    \n",
    "        The solution space will be a sudoku grid with all values filled in, where each number between 1 and 9 appears exactly once in each vertical slice and once in each horizontal slice of the grid. Beyond that, within every 3x3 subsecction, each number must also appear exactly once. The solutions will be represented as a 2d array, with 9 rows and 9 columns. The grid numbers already input in the program will remain immutable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b) Define an appropriate fitness function\n",
    "    \n",
    "        The fitness function will calculate the number of repeated tiles in rows, columns, and subsections. Fitness will correspond to the percentage of tiles which are repeated accross the whole puzzle.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c) Define a crossover operator for the chosen representation\n",
    "    \n",
    "        The crossover operator will select a random of column, row, or subsection from one representation and swap it with the corresponding tiles in another representation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    e) Decide how to initialize the population\n",
    "    \n",
    "        The population will be initialized by filling in every 0 in the submitted grid with a randomly chosen number between 1 and 9. This will be done as many times as the population size specified.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    f) Decide selection and replacement methods\n",
    "    \n",
    "        The selection method will be directly proportional to the fitness function for each individual; the worst 10% in fitness will be discarded, and replaced with crossovers of the top 20%.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    g) Choose an appropriate termination criterion\n",
    "    \n",
    "        The termination criterion will be that the sudoku grid has no repeating numbers in columns, rows, or subsections.\n",
    "    \n",
    "you should first briefly outline how you are representing the Sudoko\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then you should implement the evolutionary algorithm in Python to solve the Sudoku problem. You will need to run experiments for the three Sudoku grids provided on the ELE page, for population sizes 10, 100, 1000, 10000. Each experiment needs to be ran 5 times (Each with a different random seed) and average performance across runs considered. In total these amount to 60 runs.\n",
